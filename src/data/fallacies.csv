In fact, Pope Francis has recently (2014) spoken out against this fallacy, stating that ""When we read about Creation in Genesis, we run the risk of imagining God was a magician, with a magic wand able to do everything.

Therefore, the best solution is suicide.",but,Fallacy Of Slippery Slope,"The death of one person to save three does not necessarily mean that the murder of one person outside of this situation will result in three lives being spared, nor that there is a moral imperative to murder. Even if you accept that every person alive will be involved in the dilemma, it is incontrovertible that the rate of deaths if one person dies instead of three will reduce to 1/3 of the outcome where the three people die instead of one."

And the people who oppose abortions are usually against the idea of having to pay for anything in society in the first place.,but,Begging The Question,Where has it been established that an unwanted child costs society more than that child gives back to society over the course of his or her life?
280,Abortion should be illegal.,https://en.arguman.org/abortion-should-be-illegal,"The very early stage of a process does not equal the final stage of a human being.

This is undefined, just as the point at which a ""fetus"" becomes a ""baby"" is undefined, and it is a fallacy to pretend that ""it is not defined"" means ""it is not a problem.""

You can change between the two, but you can't be anything other than those 2. Therefore, gender is not a social construct.

282,Animal factory farms are immoral.,https://en.arguman.org/animal-factory-farms-are-immoral,"The fact that humans (in modern societies) can now have a healthy and fulfilling diet without the need to kill animals for their protein, makes it immoral to continue killing sentient beings just for their taste.

2) There were any number of similar wealth transfer (""Socialist"" in the common parlance) programs implemented before this period such as Social Security that researchers believe had enormous impacts on poverty in the U.S. (GV Engelhardt, J Gruber, 2004 - NBER). So the cutoff suggested in this premise is totally arbitrary and quite misleading.

310,Semi-colons are pointless in Javascript,https://en.arguman.org/semi-colons-are-unnecessary-in-javascript,javascript is pointless,because,Irrelevant Conclusion,That's not what this debate is about
311,Programming languages with fancy type systems (like Haskell) will never become mainstream.,https://en.arguman.org/fancy-type-systems-like-haskells-will-never-be-mainstream,"I don't believe it is. I interact with a lot of programmers in a major metro and I would argue the majority of working programmers still never heard of Haskell.
The number of people who are actually paid to write Haskell is still very small.",but,Pragmatic Fallacy,Knowledge of Haskell is regarded as a merit of deeper theorethical understanding of many underlaying functional-related mechanisms operating just like those in Java or C# and as such is recognised by largest IT players like Google or Microsoft (just read their job offers)
312,Arguman needs better tools for handling fallacy reporting,https://en.arguman.org/arguman-needs-better-tools-for-handling-fallacy-reporting,"It is possible to give a poor argument that the premise is a fallacy or falsely report fallacies with flippant comments in an attempt to delegitimize an argument.
There is no community moderation on these reports thus illegitimate reports stay permanently on arguments.",because,Prejudicial Language,Fallacy reports like this one stay around.

Why would you breakdown your own people to not pollute, if China is going to continue doing what the are doing.

317,Transhumanism is evolution continuing by other means,https://en.arguman.org/transhumanism-is-evolution-continuing-by-other-means,"Transhumanism is a death cult worshiping a robotic race that can easily destroy them.
They often sell the idea of digital immortality through the mechanism of programming a robot with your memories.
This isn't impossible but optimistic transhumanists aren't skeptical enough about approaches.",but,Fallacy Of Red Herring,"This statement constitutes an extreme appeal to emotion, immediately using highly charged language to attack transhumanism without providing any solid evidence."
318,Capitalism is fundamentally flawed.,https://en.arguman.org/capitalism-is-fundamentally-flawed,"It recovers from crises much faster than systems that are not bound to the free, individual assessment of value by the society (liberal market).",but,Irrelevant Conclusion,"Whether or not this claim is true, it does not respond to the premise that capitalism requires infinite resources, and therefore totally misses the point and misleads the audience."
319,Income should be equal,https://en.arguman.org/income-should-be-equal,"If everyone's income was zero (i.e. equal), would that eliminate abuse and anxiety? I suspect not.",but,Poisoning The Well,Attempt to discredit an argument by hyperbole. Just because people would suffer at zero income for obvious reasons does not discredit the argument at livable income(the likely original intention.)

325,Taxation is not theft.,https://en.arguman.org/taxation-is-not-theft,Most people who are taxed do not live in a totalitarian dictatorship where the monarch owns all property and currency.,however,Fallacy Of Red Herring,Crown ownership of the land does not imply totalitarian dictatorship.

326,Democracy is flawed.,https://en.arguman.org/democracy-is-flawed,It is the best we have so far.,however,Begging The Question,There is no evidence that democracy is the best political system we have as other systems have not been tested under scientific conditions.

328,Any society should reject political refugees.,https://en.arguman.org/any-society-should-reject-political-refugees,The people who would abandon their home instead of fighting for freedom and justice have no value to the host society.,because,Irrelevant Conclusion,An individuals support of freedom and justice is not the only measure of value an individual can provide to a society. This conclusion is reached by purposefully ignoring any scientific or economic benefit a person could bring.

Everything you can imagine is out there, just not likely to cross paths. It wasn't that long ago the churches were burning people for saying earth does not revolve around the sun. Infinite!",because,Appeal To Belief,There is no proof everything we can imagine is out there. Unless the universe is infinite(which we have no strong evidence for) just because I can imagine a planet of lusty catgirls does not imply the existence of a planet of lusty catgirls.
330,Tabs are better than spaces for indentation (programming),https://en.arguman.org/tabs-are-better-than-spaces,Tabs carry more semantic information than spaces. Case in point: Converting from tabs to spaces is easy but going back the other way is hard (information is lost).,because,Irrelevant Conclusion,"The semantics have nothing to do with the question. You're also not showing how you lose any information. It seems like a two-way operation. ""Hardness"" is relative, and does not indicate loss of information."

Theft is immoral. If the universal healthcare is financed through taxes, then implementing it is morally unjustifiable.",but,Fallacy Of Red Herring,"A nation cannot function without taxation, and there is nothing immoral about supporting the nation in which one lives.
It is not theft if the taxation is legal.

Proof requires an advocate and a skeptic to reach agreement, that is all proof is (in the material sciences). Two parties might never agree not because either is wrong in an absolute sense, but because they do not share initial axioms.",but,Wrong Direction,"As the comment does not try to value proof, and only claims that any party has the same amount. Which would be, none."
345,Entertainment piracy is the best thing that ever happened to American Culture,https://en.arguman.org/entertainment-piracy-is-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-american-culture,It gives people access to media they may not be able to access in their country normally or that did not have an international release.

346,The taking of a life is not immoral.,https://en.arguman.org/the-taking-of-a-life-is-not-amoral,"Humans are programed to want to forward the species, not the opposite. Therefore, it is immoral to kill because it is the opposite of human nature.",but,Fallacy Of Is To Ought,"Just because humans are (possibly) programmed not kill each other, it does not follow that they ought not to."
347,"There should be a market for organs (both organs of deceased and extra organs of living, like kidney)",https://en.arguman.org/there-should-be-a-market-for-organs,It is an entirely non-consensual practice that would effectively force those living in poverty to surrender their internal tissues at steadily lesser prices.,but,Fallacy Of Slippery Slope,Its a fallacy to say that because poor people could sell organs that they would compelled to as well. Some certainly may choose that it would not be worth.
348,The US should repeal the 16th amendment to remove federal income taxes and instead implement the FairTax.,https://en.arguman.org/the-us-should-repeal-the-16th-amendment-to-remove-federal-income-taxes-and-instead-implement-the-fairtax,"It forces the burden of taxes to fall equally on the poor as the super wealthy; and it is therefore a step backwards into further inequality. With great power comes great responsibility, and power is wealth in a capitalist society. Only progressive taxes are therefore just.",but,Appeal To Belief,Saying only progressive taxation is just implies the belief that the government has the moral support to tax in the first place.
349,Free will (the existence of autonomous human decisions made neither predictably nor randomly) is not real.,https://en.arguman.org/free-will-the-idea-that-humans-make-decisions-in-a-way-that-is-not-predictable-is-not-random-and-is-under-the-control-of-the-person-is-not-real,Human Beings do have a choice in how we respond to the world around us.

352,Taxation is not theft.,https://en.arguman.org/taxation-is-not-theft,"If you don't want to buy the apple, you are free to walk out the store. That is a voluntary exchange. You can't go to someone's wallet, request money to keep yourself in power, and get mad when they say I worked for that money. That is an involuntary exchange. The government enforces a monopoly.",but,False Analogy,You can walk out of the state as well. Remaining is consent.
353,Taxation is not theft.,https://en.arguman.org/taxation-is-not-theft,"If the consequences of disagreeing are coercion and punishment, then the agreement of society is not voluntary.",but,Irrelevant Conclusion,"Those are the consequences of continuing to benefit from the state without contributing.
You can leave the state if you disagree."

When it comes to education, housing, wealth and most other major areas, the disparity in power is so great as to make those few rare cases practically irrelevant.",but,Irrelevant Conclusion,You are doing the true Scotsman fallacy.

It is not the same as antibiotic resistance (where over use can be a problem).
Unlike antibiotics, vaccines do not kill pathogens. They train our immune systems to recognise the pathogens ahead of time, so that our immune systems are already primed to fight them off on contact.
Any apparent resistance that might emerge would actually by variants of the pathogen that were never covered by the vaccine to start with. We then respond with a new vaccine covering more variants.
Over all, achieving a very high level of vaccination is more likely to result in the eradication of the entire pathogen population, as per the example of Smallpox.

784,Taxation is not theft.,https://en.arguman.org/taxation-is-not-theft,"A thief steals for his/her own gain and does not give back to the victim; a government gives back to those taxed in the form of a police force and other humanitarian necessities, schools, and roads. A government cannot give necessary services without some form of income.",but,Fallacy Of Special Pleading,"If someone not apart of the government breaks into a building, even if they believe doing so is for the greater good, they are still a burglar. If someone were to hold a child in a building against their will and demand their parents pay them, it would be kidnapping with ransom."

The choice to become religious is personal, and not something one is forced into by for example parents.",but,Irrelevant Conclusion,"You brought ""forcing"" into the argument without me using it. FORCING a child to do most activities is mostly child abuse anyway so it's irrelevant to the discussion."

794,Functional programming is not useful for most apps,https://en.arguman.org/functional-programming-is-not-useful,Some impressive results are being achieved with functional languages today. For example a recent success in this area is the Amazon competitor Jet.com. Functional languages are increasing in number and popularity which shows increasing applicability to real world challenges.,but,Appeal To Authority,Just because Amazon or some other company was successfully using it doesn't mean it supports the counter-argument. One could also count every other company that uses an other paradigm... Nothing argumentative achieved by this.
795,Ethnic diversity reduces social solidarity and diminishes social capital,https://en.arguman.org/ethnic-diversity-reduces-social-solidarity-and-diminishes-social-capital,Ethnic diversity reduces concern for the environment.,because,Slothful Induction,Your own citation disagrees with you.

Some believe that the universe is actually 13.8 billion years old and that god did use evolution to create. They interpret their religious texts and certain word usages to support scientific findings.,however,Irrelevant Conclusion,That is called theistic evolution and a) has no basis to prove it and b) is irrelevant since it's technically not creationism.
797,React is killing Angular,https://en.arguman.org/react-is-killing-angular,Angular2 is not backward compatible,because,Fallacy Of Red Herring,Angular 2's backward incompatibility is not the reason why React is killing Angular (if it is).

799,There is not sufficient evidence to justify belief in a god.,https://en.arguman.org/there-is-not-sufficient-evidence-to-justify-belief-in-a-god,"There is the Kalam argument. One of the laws of physics effectively states that everything with a beginning has a cause. Science agrees that the universe has a beginning, yet cannot give a cause. A higher being or God would be a reasonable assumption as there are no other options",but,Appeal To Belief,"God is not a ""reasonable"" possibility for a cause outside this universe. It requires way too many assumptions."
800,Static typing is better than dynamic typing in programming languages.,https://en.arguman.org/static-typing-is-better-than-dynamic-typing-in-programming-languages,It's easier to manage a large team or a big codebase.,because,Fallacy Of Red Herring,"Being properly designed is what makes a system and teams easier to manage, not whether their typification is static or dynamic."
801,Functional programming is not useful for most apps,https://en.arguman.org/functional-programming-is-not-useful,"""The problem is that most common code inherently involves state -- business apps, games, UI, etc. There's no problem with some parts of an app being purely functional; in fact most apps could benefit in at least one area.

802,Changing your gender/sex is unnatural,https://en.arguman.org/changing-your-gendersex-is-unnatural,"fuzzydunlop, it is why it is a ""however"" and not a ""but"".",however,Irrelevant Conclusion,The purpose of the 'however' function is to add something that furthers the argument without supporting or denying it. A good example of this is the other 'however' statement in this argument tree which attempts to further the argument by stating we need a more elaborate definition of natural. Stating that what is natural is not necessarily right or wrong does not further this specific argument because it does not help use determine whether changing one's gender is natural or not. Whether natural things are right or wrong is a separate argument that should be talked about outside of this argument.
803,"There is no such thing as a ""good"" police officer",https://en.arguman.org/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-good-police-officer,Police are under no legal obligation to protect and serve.,because,Fallacy Of Red Herring,"Just because police officers are not obligated to protect and serve does not mean that there are no ""good"" police officers. Officers can still protect and serve even though they are not obligated to. You have also not supported with evidence that protecting and serving is necessary for being a ""good"" police officer."
804,Changing your gender/sex is unnatural,https://en.arguman.org/changing-your-gendersex-is-unnatural,People change sex in many cases because the are uncomfortable with the imposition of gender roles upon them. These gender roles are themselves an artificial construct and are unnatural.,but,Fallacy Of Red Herring,"A possible, unnatural reason for changing gender does not determine whether the act of changing gender is natural or unnatural"
805,Functional programming is not useful for most apps,https://en.arguman.org/functional-programming-is-not-useful,"Y-combinator founder has noted that his and associate's choice of Lisp as basis for one of the first online webstores, had allowed them to beat others by (among other) implementing any new features way faster than competition due to the language used.",but,Appeal To Authority,Functional programming is not automatically better than other programming paradigms just because Y-combinator founder says so.
806,Philosophy is Useful,https://en.arguman.org/philosophy-is-useful,Philosophical thought has existed since the dawn of mankind. Philosophy as we know it started centuries before the common era and we still wonder what love is.,but,Irrelevant Conclusion,"Science started centuries before, and we still wonder how to travel at lightspeed."
807,"If bad things happen, god is either not all powerful, doesn't love us, or doesn't exist",https://en.arguman.org/if-bad-things-happen-god-is-either-not-all-powerful-doesnt-love-us-or-doesnt-exist,So if Syrian nun gets repeatedly raped and then executed by ISIS members it's because she chose not to follow god?,but,Irrelevant Conclusion,Just because bad things happen in the world doesn't mean it's because you didn't follow god. Even people who are devote followers of god have terrible things happen to them.
808,Having a one world order would actually be beneficial.,https://en.arguman.org/having-a-one-world-order-would-actually-be-beneficial,Jeremiah 10:23 says human governments cannot rule the world. Daniel 2:44 says God will bring out just one government that will be successful indefinitely.,because,Appeal To Belief,The Bible is almost never an authority in a real argument.

Why was the Computer not developed in non-white countries? Why was the Industrial revolution not shared with the world from China or India? Why was the theory of Evolution or Relativity achieved in white society?,but,Begging The Question,The argument begs itself by picking only those examples that support its argument as the only examples that are relevant.
811,"History is the repeating story of the White race building great Civilizations and pushing Humanity forwards, only to import other races and miscegenerate with them - whereupon the Civilization crumbles and destroys itself.",https://en.arguman.org/history-is-the-repeating-story-of-the-white-race-building-great-civilizations-and-pushing-humanity-forwards-only-to-import-other-races-and-miscegenerate-with-them-whereupon-the-civilization-crumbles-and-destroys-itself,"History was literally defined as 'heroic acts' for most of 'history' - this means inspiring transcendental civilizational epochs where humanity was pushed forwards - 'Great civilizations' are more important and heroic, white people construct these and generate the heroics that have lasting impact.",but,Fallacy Of Special Pleading,Deliberately ignoring Chinese history in order to avoid counterexamples

Just the problem to be visible doesn't implies that someone is going fix it.",but,Begging The Question,Just because it is Open Source doesn't mean its maintenance has to be gratis. A school or government agency could still hire developers to maintain it. It would be from the people to the people.

815,There is no such thing as global warming.,https://en.arguman.org/there-is-no-such-thing-as-global-warming,"The models used to project that the planet is warming involve a number of questionable assumptions, simplifying mathematical approximations, questionable modeling shortcuts, persistent disagreement over fundamental processes, and base upon insufficient data to make a certain claim",but,Fallacy Of Special Pleading,The statement depends on a trend to suddenly stop. A trend by definition is expected to continue in the same direction. The argument doesn't explain why this trend would not follow that expectation.
816,Panentheism is the only logical theology,https://en.arguman.org/panentheism-is-the-only-logical-theology,"If a supreme being exists, it must contain everything that exists, or else it is not the greatest being.",because,Irrelevant Conclusion,This does not relate to the premise at hand
817,The government should be required to use open source software (for civilian operations at least),https://en.arguman.org/the-government-should-be-required-to-use-open-source-software,"We are talking about banning privative software, so it is black and white. For example if PostgreSQL were privative then the government would not have access to scalable SQL databases, which are great and having a good SQL database usually is worth the license (ask Oracle).",but,Irrelevant Conclusion,Wikipedia is running on Open Source databases (MariaDB) and has proven to handle scale quite well.
818,Python is better than Ruby,https://en.arguman.org/python-is-better-than-ruby,It's named after a bitchin snake!,because,Fallacy Of Red Herring,

Some or all decisions come from souls.,but,Appeal To Belief,There is no soul
822,Evolution is not fact.,https://en.arguman.org/evolution-is-not-fact,Macroevolution is easily explained and if you would research the cambrian explosion and it's circumstances for more than 5 minutes you would see that there is no problem with that.,but,Poisoning The Well,"Argument assumes that the poster had not done more than 5 minutes of research, rather than presenting evidence that the poster is wrong."
823,The government should be required to use open source software (for civilian operations at least),https://en.arguman.org/the-government-should-be-required-to-use-open-source-software,It would turn us all into communists,but,Irrelevant Conclusion,Its not clear that adoption of open source software would lead to much of society adopting a different political philosophy.
824,All recreational drugs should be legalized but heavily regulated.,https://en.arguman.org/all-recreational-drugs-should-be-legalized-but-heavily-regulated,"Illegal drug users are, by definition, criminals. And criminality generally negatively impacts your life. Therefore this entire thread of argumentation appears to be flawed.",but,Fallacy Of Slippery Slope,Crime does not inevitably lead to a negative outcome.
825,Having a one world order would actually be beneficial.,https://en.arguman.org/having-a-one-world-order-would-actually-be-beneficial,Jeremiah 10:23 says human governments cannot rule the world.

Bible says something about that topic. Bible is probably correct.
826,Having a one world order would actually be beneficial.,https://en.arguman.org/having-a-one-world-order-would-actually-be-beneficial,"A world order that promoted worldwide/universal togetherness could be nothing but beneficial for all of humanity, but one that encouraged slaughter and *total* anarchy would be destructive.",because,Begging The Question,"Only two possible outcomes? How about a decentralized ""world order"" where people could decide how they organize matters in their living environment(s)?
Besides, anarchy means nothing but non-existence of power hiearchy and centralized control.

827,Creationism is a scientific doctrine,https://en.arguman.org/creationism-is-a-scientific-doctrine,You can believe in a God without believing in the notion that evolution did not occur and that the world is not 6000 years old.,however,Irrelevant Conclusion,This is unrelated to the argument
828,The government should be required to use open source software (for civilian operations at least),https://en.arguman.org/the-government-should-be-required-to-use-open-source-software,It would turn us all into communists,but,Poisoning The Well,Using condemning language with no explanation

If he does, I literally wouldn't care if he died. Scum.",because,Fallacy Of Red Herring,"This isn't so much a fallacy as it is an evasion tactic. The red herring is similar to a ""wild goose chase."" When someone leads the debate off on a red herring, they are trying to divert attention away from a particular argument, and toward some inconsequential statement that you may have made, or inventing some tangent to go off on."
834,Static typing is better than dynamic typing in programming languages.,https://en.arguman.org/static-typing-is-better-than-dynamic-typing-in-programming-languages,Some consistent and logic domain models can not be crafted in most static typed programming languages.,but,Slothful Induction,Thats simply not true. Turing complete languages are equal in expressiveness. One could for instance just use the topmost Supertype or Stringify everything to express the same as in dynamic languages.

836,If the universe is infinite it has always existed and always will,https://en.arguman.org/if-the-universe-is-infinite-it-has-always-existed-and-always-will,There are different kinds of infinity.,but,Fallacy Of Irrelevant Purpose,Therefore to invalidate the statement you have to give a proof that from finite universe you can pass to the smallest infinite.
